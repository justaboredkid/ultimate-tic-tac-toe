# How to play

For the basic rules, [this](https://docs.riddles.io/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/rules) website will teach you the basic of, dare I say it, *Ultimate* Tic Tac Toe.  

The Controls are simple. If you have a numpad, the grid corresponds to numbers.  

For example, if you want to fill in the middle square, press '5' on your numpad.
